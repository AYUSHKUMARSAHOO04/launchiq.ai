# Request Flow Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

User->>Frontend: Enter Product Data

Frontend->>Simulation Engine: Process Simulation

Simulation Engine->>Groq API: Send AI Prompt

Groq API-->>Simulation Engine: Strategic JSON Response

Simulation Engine->>JSON Parser: Validate Structure

JSON Parser->>Supabase: Save Simulation Results

Supabase-->>Frontend: Stored Response

Frontend-->>User: Display Launch Dashboard
```

---

# Data Flow

### Step 1 — User Input
Users enter:

- Product Name
- Category
- Industry
- Target Audience
- Pricing
- Product Features
- Competitors
- Launch Goal
- Market Region

### Step 2 — AI Processing
LaunchIQ.ai sends structured prompts to:

```txt
Groq LLM (Llama 3.3 70B Versatile)
```

for strategic launch intelligence.

### Step 3 — Response Structuring
AI responses are transformed into structured JSON outputs.

### Step 4 — Database Storage
Simulation results are stored securely in:

```txt
Supabase PostgreSQL
```

### Step 5 — Dashboard Generation
Users receive:

- Purchase likelihood  
- Launch risk score  
- Market sentiment  
- Executive strategic summary  
- Pricing recommendations  
- Competitive positioning  
- SWOT analysis  
- Go-To-Market strategy
